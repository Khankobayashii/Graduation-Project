Traffic Sign Recognition using YOLOv8 and PyQt5
This graduation project focuses on building a real-time traffic sign recognition system using the YOLOv8 deep learning model. The system is integrated into a user-friendly desktop application built with PyQt5, featuring voice feedback for enhanced usability. The project includes dataset preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and application deployment. It aims to support safer driving by providing quick and accurate identification of road signs, especially for motorcycles and smart traffic systems.

Key Features:

Real-time traffic sign detection with YOLOv8

Desktop interface built with PyQt5

Voice feedback integration using text-to-speech

Custom-trained model using a curated dataset from Roboflow

Suitable for smart transportation and driver-assistance systems
